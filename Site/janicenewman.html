                    <p>
                         Janice Newman formed The Newman Law Group in 2012 because she believes that every client deserves high-quality sophisticated legal representation.  She has more than 30 years experience as a transactional general corporate and real estate attorney. Janice represents clients in forming their business entity through the issues that arise as they engage in their business. Her clients include private equity funds and real estate developers in the purchase and sale of alternative assets, real estate management companies and broker dealers, as well as executives and individuals. She also founded and ran her own e-commerce supply chain logistics company for almost 10 years.
                         <br><br>
                         Janice started her career at a large New York law firm, specializing in mergers and acquisitions and securities offerings.  She moved to Florida and continued her practice as of counsel to Greenberg Traurig in Fort Lauderdale. She participated as both issuers’ and underwriters’ counsel in the public and private placement of debt and equity securities.  Her clients included publicly traded companies, including a major entertainment distribution company and a public limited partnership.  She formed her own business that she ran until 2010 when, eager to move back north, a client asked her to represent him in forming and managing a real estate investment trust (REIT). 
                         <br><br>
                         Janice graduated, cum laude, from Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University, where she was a Belkin Scholar, winner and best oral advocate, Jacob Burns Moot Court Competition and winner and regional champion of the National Moot Court Competition. She is also a cum laude graduate of Long Island University.
                         <br><br>
                         Janice is admitted to practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the States of New York and Florida.  She is a member of the New York State Bar Association, the Pennsylvania Bar Association, the Florida Bar Association, the American Bar Association and the Delaware County, Pennsylvania Bar Association.
